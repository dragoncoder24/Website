# Captain Jack: Personal Website

A personal portfolio / interactive dashboard themed around the chaos, philosophy, and occasional brilliance of Captain Jack Sparrow. This project mixes a slightly weathered pirate aesthetic with modern web wizardry.

> Warning: parts of this code might make you feel like you’re walking the plank through spaghetti. Enjoy responsibly.

## Project Philosophy

This… uh, site is guided by a few loosely held principles:

- **Interesting Lines** – detours, quirks, and all the tiny things that make code (and life) weirdly fun.
- **Strategic Automation** – if it can be done once, don’t do it twice… unless you forget how you did it.
- **Pokable Systems** – if something looks impossible, just poke it until it works… or maybe explodes.

## Features

### 1. The Cursed Compass
An SVG-based compass that follows your mouse across the screen. Like Jack’s original compass, it mostly points toward what you want, or at least where your cursor wants. Occasionally it lies.

### 2. Interactive Manifest
A scroll of personal OS quirks, curiosities, and questionable ideas.

- **Dynamic Quotes** – Hover over “Personal Operating System” items to get a random quip from 80+ iconic lines. Or not.
- **Pali & Pursuits** – Notes on ancient languages, meditation, and, strangely, Badminton.

### 3. Ship Vitals (Caffeine/Rum Logic)
Because morale is important:

- **The Meter** – A visual bar tracking caffeine or rum levels.
- **Drink & Discuss** – Using supplies triggers Captain ramblings. Results vary.

### 4. Identity & Bounty System
An interactive “Wanted Poster” generator:

- Assign yourself a pirate alias.
- **Commit Digital Crimes** (like automating boring tasks) to increase your bounty in real time.
- Warning: actual crimes not included. Not responsible for parrots.

### 5. Night Mode (The Candle)
A global toggle that applies a night filter to the site. Useless little feature that gives vibes.

### 6. Blog & 404
- **Blog** – Posts and mini-logs powered by Firebase Firestore.
- **404 Page** – Friendly “lost at sea” page with some humor for wandering devs.

---

## Technical Setup

- Multi-page site (`index.html`, `blog.html`, `404.html`, etc.)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), Vanilla JS
- **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication + Firestore for logs and subscribers)
- **Typography:** Google Fonts (Pirata One, Special Elite)
- **Assets:** Transparent textures for leather & parchment effects

> The code is intentionally messy. You might trip over a variable, a comment, or a forgotten TODO. That’s part of the charm.

---

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Use the top nav bar to switch between Manifest, Vitals, Bounties, Identity, or Blog.
3. If you wander somewhere wrong, the 404 will remind you that you’re lost at sea.
4. Check the developer console for secret greetings from the Captain. He apparently likes the console more than humans.
